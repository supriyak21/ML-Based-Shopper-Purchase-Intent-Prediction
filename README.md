In this project, we tackled a real-world business problem faced by e-commerce platforms: Identifying which website visitors are likely to make a purchase. 

Using the UCI Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset, we applied end-to-end data science workflows including EDA, feature engineering, and model building to uncover behavioral and contextual patterns that drive online conversions. We engineered impactful features like total engagement time and pruned redundant variables to improve model interpretability. Our data preprocessing pipeline ensured clean, scaled inputs ready for robust classification. 
We experimented with multiple supervised learning models—
1.Logistic Regression
2.Decision Tree
3.Random Forest
4.XGBoost
5.AutoML frameworks- PyCaret and H2O

This project demonstrates how raw behavioral data can be transformed into actionable insights using scalable machine learning pipelines. By combining feature engineering, model tuning, and AutoML, we built a high-performing classification system to improve online shopper conversion rates—reaching 91.4% accuracy and 0.9434 AUC.
